			<p>Thirteen is a playing card game where four players try to be the first to get rid of all their cards.  My friends and I had a phase where we spent hours playing Thirteen so I thought it'd be interesting to recreate it.  Figuring out how to code bots that could play Thirteen in a not completely dumb way was fun and tickled my brain.  I used C# in Visual Studio for this project.</p>
