			<p>As a kid, one of my favorite things to do was make card games.  I would cut out 2.5 by 3.5 inch boxes of stiff drawing paper and round the edges.  I designed Pokemon inspired monsters, came up with rules and lore, and hand drew every single card.  For bring-a-board-game day, I brought my cards to school and had so much fun playing with my classmates.  That was my thing for a while, and though I eventually stopped, I've always wanted to code my own multiplayer card game.</p>
			<p>As you might expect, this isn't my first rodeo when it comes to attempting this.  I don't how many card game programs I've started but haven't finished because I hit a roadblock and gave up.  One was a hacky website using Firebase's RTDB for the backend which blew my mind once I got it to work because I'd never really understood how multiplayer connections worked.  I also didn't know Git at the time, so I didn't have a backup of my code and sadly lost it when my computer stopped turning on.  This time around, I know a bit more about version control, server-client architecture, etc, so I decided to give it one more shot and hopefully complete something substanstial from start to finish.</p>

			<p>The main features I'm planning for this project are the game logic, terminal user interface, deck-building, ability to create/join servers, and play against bots.  At the time of writing this, I've finished 90% of the TUI and am excited to work on the networking part.  It'll be uncharted territory for me, but I think it'll be cool to dip my toes in concurrency and TCP sockets.</p>
